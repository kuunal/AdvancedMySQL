Full-text search is a technique to search for documents that don’t perfectly match the search criteria. Documents are database entities that contain textual data e.g., product description, blog post, and articles.

For example, you can search for Wood and Metal, FTS can return results that contain the searched words separately, just Wood or Metal, or results that contain the words in a different order Word and Metal, or Metal and Wood

alter table product add FULLTEXT(title);

	 create fulltext index titleFT on product(title);
	 
	 
	 
	 ALTER TABLE product
DROP INDEX titleFT;

select title from product where match(title) against ('girl');

boolean mode

select title from product where match(title) against ('girl -sleeping' in boolean mode);

–	Exclude, the word must not be present.
+	Include, the word must be present.

>	Include, and increase ranking value.
<	Include, and decrease the ranking value.

he query expansion is used to widen the search result of the full-text searches based on automatic relevance feedback (or blind query expansion). Technically, MySQL full-text search engine performs the following steps when the query expansion is used:

First, search for all rows that match the search query.
Second, find the relevant words in all rows from the search result.
Third, search again based on the relevant words instead of the original keywords specified by users.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE MATCH(column1,column2) 
      AGAINST('keyword',WITH QUERY EXPANSION);
